AutoWiring: 
Automatic dependency injection

FOUR different type dependency injection can be done in Spring : 
1> by name
2> by type
3> constructor
4> auto detect

by default auto wiring is 'no'


suppose we have ref tag in bean and Auto wiring is also activated then two objects will be 
injected at the same time, this is the problem with auto wiring,

Hibernate Template
Hibernate mapping file
Hibernate configuration file we need to create

First Configuration Object ---> Session Factory ----> Session Object ( DB operations ) ---> Transaction Object

For using annotations we need to define in xml file <context:annotation-config/>
